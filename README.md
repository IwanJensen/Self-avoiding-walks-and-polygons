# Self-avoiding walks and polygons crossing domains on the square and hexagonal lattices
Here are the data files for our project on walks and polygons in domains of the square and hexagonal lattices. 
Each file first list the exact enumeration terms followed by several approximate terms. 

We include a Maple worksheet so you can play with the numerical analysis (see our paper ...) for what we did.

The code used to generate the exact enumeration data is included as well. You may use and change this as you please provided you give due acknowledgement in any work that follows.
