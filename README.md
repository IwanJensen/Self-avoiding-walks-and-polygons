# Self-avoiding walks and polygons crossing domains on the square and hexagonal lattices
Here are the data files for our project on walks and polygons in domains of the square and hexagonal lattices. 
Each file first list the exact enumeration terms followed by several approximate terms. 

We include a Maple worksheet so you can play with the numerical analysis (see our paper "Self-avoiding walks and polygons crossing a domain on the square and
  hexagonal lattices", http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06744) for what we did. The data for unresttricted and touching square SAWs and square lattice cycles was used in our paper "Self-avoiding walks contained within a square", https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09731.

The code used to generate the exact enumeration data for SAW and SAP crossing a rhombus is included as well. In the SAW case we have included a parallel OpenMP version. You may use and change this as you please provided you give due acknowledgement in any work that follows.
